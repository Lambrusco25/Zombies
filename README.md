Merged Esx Zombie Script

I tried to make a good v1 esx zombie script with this two (esx_zombiesystem and ZO Zombie Outbreak framework both scripts are from Dislaik), but it didn't went well.
**Reason Why I did this:** I wanted a esx v1 zombies script with synced zombies and grunt sounds. I thought merging this 2 scripts would be a great idea because they complete each other very well.
Anyway I will post the script here, in hopes that somebody tries to do something out of this.
